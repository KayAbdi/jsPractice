## The sum of a range
The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:

### console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.

Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.

As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call <b> range(1, 10, 2) </b> should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].

# Hints 
There are two obvious ways to implement reverseArray. The first is to simply go over the input array from front to back and use the unshift method on the new array to insert each element at its start. The second is to loop over the input array backwards and use the push method. Iterating over an array backwards requires a (somewhat awkward) for specification, like (let i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--).

Reversing the array in place is harder. You have to be careful not to overwrite elements that you will later need. Using reverseArray or otherwise copying the whole array (array.slice(0) is a good way to copy an array) works but is cheating.

The trick is to swap the first and last elements, then the second and second-to-last, and so on. You can do this by looping over half the length of the array (use Math.floor to round down—you don’t need to touch the middle element in an array with an odd number of elements) and swapping the element at position i with the one at position array.length - 1 - i. You can use a local binding to briefly hold on to one of the elements, overwrite that one with its mirror image, and then put the value from the local binding in the place where the mirror image used to be.
